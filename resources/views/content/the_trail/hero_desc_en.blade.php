    The Spice Routes is an <b>ancient, complex, and vast civilization that affected the global civilization</b>. Its
    traces display cultural interactions in the past. <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"><br><br>

        The people of Nusantara’s openness and cultural relations gave rise to multicultural and multiethnic heritage in
        different mediums. The cultural ties between people left some <b>legacies and a series of traces:</b> the story
        of the origin, songs, music, dances, traditional technology, building architecture, fashion, culinary, potions,
        letters, languages, and beliefs. It is a cultural heritage that has become Indonesia’s collective memory as
        proof and traces of the Spice Routes. </span>
