    The Spice Routes is forward-looking. The program focuses on increasing the public's
    awareness to conserve, develop, and use the Spice Routes cultural heritage (tangible and
    intangible) as an asset to promote the <b>sustainable prosperity</b> of all. <br><br>

    It is a point of view that sets off from the traces which link to one another and form a
    cultural ecosystemâ€”a means of <b>reconstruction and revitalization</b> through the sea
    as a symbol of wealth and prosperity. <br><br>

    The Spice Routes strives to grow pride upon identities of various regions in Indonesia,
    strengthening the cultural interaction network among areas and reinforcing the national
    bond through the <b>nautical cultural routes</b> that had existed thousands of years
    ago.<br><br>

    Through this point of view, the Spice Routes reopen regional and global communities'
    perspectives concerning the role of Indonesia as the <b>global maritime axis</b> in the
    past, present, and future.
